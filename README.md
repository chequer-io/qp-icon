Convert svg files into tsx files to make icons easy to use in your React based project.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm i
npm run storybook
```

Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) with your browser to see the result.

## How to use
- Create an svg file. (We recommend creating a path tag for the svg file content.)
- If there are multiple paths, do not adjust the color with CSS.
- Paste the svg file into the `icons` folder in the project.
- `npm run storybook`
- Check your browser
